# Virtual-Drum
This project is virtual drum set for anyone having just a webcam and a computer! Using computer vision, it detects your drum stick and maps its location on the screen to different drum sounds. Strike specific regions on the screen with the stick to play corresponding sounds like kick, snare, hi-hat, creating a realistic drumming experience.
